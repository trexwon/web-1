  The World Wide Web (WWW), also called the Web,
is an information space where documents and other
web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs),
interlinked by hypertext links, and accessible via the Internet.
English scientist Tim Berners-Lee and Belgian informatics engineer Robert
Cailliau invented the World Wide Web in 1989. They wrote the first web browser
in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland. The browser was released outside CERN
in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general
public on the Internet in August 1991.
