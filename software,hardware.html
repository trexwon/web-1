    <h1>software</h1>
    <h1><p>Computer software, or simply software, is a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built, that actually performs the work. 
        In computer science and software engineering, computer software is all information processed by computer systems, programs and data. 
        Computer software includes computer programs, libraries and related non-executable data, such as online documentation or digital media. 
        Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own.
        At the lowest level, executable code consists of machine language instructions supported by an individual processor—typically a central processing unit or a graphics processing unit. 
        A machine language consists of groups of binary values signifying processor instructions that change the state of the computer from its preceding state. 
        For example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer—an effect that is not directly observable to the user. 
        An instruction may also invoke one of many input or output operations, for example displaying some text on a computer screen; causing state changes which should be visible to the user. 
        The processor executes the instructions in the order they are provided, unless it is instructed to "jump" to a different instruction, or is interrupted by the operating system. 
        As of 2015, most personal computers, smartphone devices and servers have processors with multiple execution units or multiple processors performing computation together, and computing has become a much more concurrent activity than in the past.
        The majority of software is written in high-level programming languages that are easier and more efficient for programmers to use because they are closer than machine languages to natural languages. 
        High-level languages are translated into machine language using a compiler or an interpreter or a combination of the two. 
        Software may also be written in a low-level assembly language, which has strong correspondence to the computer's machine language instructions and is translated into machine </p></h1>
        
        <h1>hardware</h1>
        <h1><p>omputer hardware includes the physical parts or components of a computer, such as the central processing unit, monitor, keyboard, computer data storage, graphic card, sound card, speakers and motherboard. 
            By contrast, software is instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. Hardware is so-termed because it is "hard" or rigid with respect to changes or modifications; whereas software is "soft" because it can be easily updated or changed. 
            Intermediate between software and hardware is "firmware", which is software that is strongly coupled to the particular hardware of a computer system and thus the most difficult to change but also among the most stable with respect to consistency of interface. 
            The progression from levels of "hardness" to "softness" in computer systems parallels a progression of layers of abstraction in computing.
            Hardware is typically directed by the software to execute any command or instruction. 
            A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system, although other systems exist with only hardware components.</p></h1>
